# University-Projets
In this repository I am trying to expands the ideas initiated during my master thesis in physics of complex systems. 
# Portfolio-selection
The portfolio selection is my 3rd project in shahid beheshti university which is going on as my master thesis. In this project I along with my supervisors, Dr. Nasiri and Dr. Jafari, are aiming to unveil the secrets of portfolio selection in financial markets. The method used is a new burgeoning idea called Quantum socail science and specifically the use of quantum potential in developing the toolkits of financial behaviors.
